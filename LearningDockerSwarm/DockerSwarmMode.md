```
Feature highlights
Cluster management integrated with Docker Engine: Use the Docker Engine CLI to create a swarm of Docker Engines where you can deploy application services. You donâ€™t need additional orchestration software to create or manage a swarm.
Decentralized design: Instead of handling differentiation between node roles at deployment time, the Docker Engine handles any specialization at runtime. You can deploy both kinds of nodes, managers and workers, using the Docker Engine. This means you can build an entire swarm from a single disk image.
Declarative service model: Docker Engine uses a declarative approach to let you define the desired state of the various services in your application stack. For example, you might describe an application comprised of a web front end service with message queueing services and a database backend.
Scaling: For each service, you can declare the number of tasks you want to run. When you scale up or down, the swarm manager automatically adapts by adding or removing tasks to maintain the desired state.
Desired state reconciliation: The swarm manager node constantly monitors the cluster state and reconciles any differences between the actual state and your expressed desired state. For example, if you set up a service to run 10 replicas of a container, and a worker machine hosting two of those replicas crashes, the manager will create two new replicas to replace the replicas that crashed. The swarm manager assigns the new replicas to workers that are running and available.
Multi-host networking: You can specify an overlay network for your services. The swarm manager automatically assigns addresses to the containers on the overlay network when it initializes or updates the application.
Service discovery: Swarm manager nodes assign each service in the swarm a unique DNS name and load balances running containers. You can query every container running in the swarm through a DNS server embedded in the swarm.
Load balancing: You can expose the ports for services to an external load balancer. Internally, the swarm lets you specify how to distribute service containers between nodes.
Secure by default: Each node in the swarm enforces TLS mutual authentication and encryption to secure communications between itself and all other nodes. You have the option to use self-signed root certificates or certificates from a custom root CA.
Rolling updates: At rollout time you can apply service updates to nodes incrementally. The swarm manager lets you control the delay between service deployment to different sets of nodes. If anything goes wrong, you can roll-back a task to a previous version of the service.
```


## Swarm Mode Key Concepts
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/

* What is a swarm?
```
The cluster management and orchestration features embedded in the Docker Engine are built using SwarmKit. Docker engines participating in a cluster are running in swarm mode. You enable swarm mode for an engine by either initializing a swarm or joining an existing swarm.
A swarm is a cluster of Docker engines, or nodes, where you deploy services. The Docker Engine CLI and API include commands to manage swarm nodes (e.g., add or remove nodes), and deploy and orchestrate services across the swarm.
When you run Docker without using swarm mode, you execute container commands. When you run the Docker in swarm mode, you orchestrate services. You can run swarm services and standalone containers on the same Docker instances.
```

* What is a node?
```
A node is an instance of the Docker engine participating in the swarm. You can also think of this as a Docker node. You can run one or more nodes on a single physical computer or cloud server, but production swarm deployments typically include Docker nodes distributed across multiple physical and cloud machines.
To deploy your application to a swarm, you submit a service definition to a manager node. The manager node dispatches units of work called tasks to worker nodes.
Manager nodes also perform the orchestration and cluster management functions required to maintain the desired state of the swarm. Manager nodes elect a single leader to conduct orchestration tasks.
Worker nodes receive and execute tasks dispatched from manager nodes. By default manager nodes also run services as worker nodes, but you can configure them to run manager tasks exclusively and be manager-only nodes. An agent runs on each worker node and reports on the tasks assigned to it. The worker node notifies the manager node of the current state of its assigned tasks so that the manager can maintain the desired state of each worker.
```

* Services and tasks
```
A service is the definition of the tasks to execute on the worker nodes. It is the central structure of the swarm system and the primary root of user interaction with the swarm.
When you create a service, you specify which container image to use and which commands to execute inside running containers.
In the replicated services model, the swarm manager distributes a specific number of replica tasks among the nodes based upon the scale you set in the desired state.
For global services, the swarm runs one task for the service on every available node in the cluster.
A task carries a Docker container and the commands to run inside the container. It is the atomic scheduling unit of swarm. Manager nodes assign tasks to worker nodes according to the number of replicas set in the service scale. Once a task is assigned to a node, it cannot move to another node. It can only run on the assigned node or fail.
```

* Load balancing
```
The swarm manager uses ingress load balancing to expose the services you want to make available externally to the swarm. The swarm manager can automatically assign the service a PublishedPort or you can configure a PublishedPort for the service. You can specify any unused port. If you do not specify a port, the swarm manager assigns the service a port in the 30000-32767 range.
External components, such as cloud load balancers, can access the service on the PublishedPort of any node in the cluster whether or not the node is currently running the task for the service. All nodes in the swarm route ingress connections to a running task instance.
Swarm mode has an internal DNS component that automatically assigns each service in the swarm a DNS entry. The swarm manager uses internal load balancing to distribute requests among services within the cluster based upon the DNS name of the service.

## Get Started with Docker Swarm 

* docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.16.0.2
Swarm initialized: current node (yloq2964nwvqnu39jkn6bq579) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
```
    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-5h9xzburikl2lkyj5gfp778rbqj4gpc0ri02bjv6cqshbzf68z-4pk0obugc6xg2yuxiffrm1ywo \
    172.16.0.2:2377
```
To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```
>>>docker node ls
